I am a postdoctoral researcher working on agroecosystem and forest ecosystem modelling,
with a focus on ecosystem responses to disturbances, resilience, and adaptive management.

My research combines process-based modelling and decision-support approaches to
analyse how managed ecosystems respond to environmental and management pressures.
In forest ecosystems, I have worked on resilience and adaptive management strategies,
using conceptual and quantitative models to assess multifunctionality and long-term
sustainability under disturbance regimes. In parallel, I have developed and evaluated
agroecosystem models using ORCHIDEE–STICS, and conducted independent work on soil
organic carbon (SOC) modelling in forests, including the evaluation and optimisation
of SOC models (e.g. AMG-Forest) using long-term experimental data and FluxNet observations.
